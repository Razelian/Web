        <h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2>
        <p>One of the most diverse and flexible branches of engineering, mechanical engineering deals with the study of objects and systems in motion. This branch impacts almost every aspect of life today, even as a human body can be treated as an extremely intricate machine.</p>
        <p>Mechanical engineers are very important in the industries, such as automotive, aerospace, biotechnology, computing, electronics, microelectromechanical systems, energy conversion, robotics, automation, and manufacturing.</p>
        <p>The broad scope of mechanical engineering opens up numerous career opportunities outside these fields. In every one of these fields, however, a mechanical engineering education provides students with creative skills to design innovative products or systems, analytical tools for meeting design objectives, resilience for tackling challenges, and the ability to collaborate to develop, market, and manufacture their creations.</p>    
        <!--<p>Learn about energy systems, robotics, and advancements in mechanical technologies.</p>-->
